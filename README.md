This repository demonstrates an uncommon JavaScript bug related to the handling of null values and the absence of type checking in a simple addition function. The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.  The bug manifests when null values are passed as arguments, leading to unexpected behavior.  The solution addresses this by implementing robust null checks and type validation before performing the addition. This example highlights the importance of thorough input validation and defensive programming in JavaScript to avoid unexpected results and runtime errors.
